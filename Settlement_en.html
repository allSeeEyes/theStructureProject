The materials of these buildings is adopted according to local circumstances; and their constructions reflect the principle of “harmony and coexistence between man and nature”. With a long period of development, these dwellings become a relatively unique branch of Chinese architectural styles, which is also the treasure of Chinese residential buildings.-->

                    Traditional Western Sichuan Dwellings are one school of Chinese residential architecture of the Han people. Owing to the special geographical location and climatic conditions in Chuanxi Basin, architectural materials of these dwellings directly come from forests and mountains in this place, which forms a unique western Sichuan architecture style. In addition, cultural factors, such as exchanges and integration of different cultures, also affect the architecture style in this region.

                    Owing to the complex geographic conditions, the Western Sichuan Plain provides abundant sources of building materials, such as wood, bamboo, clay and straw, for Western Sichuan Dwellings. Western Sichuan Plain is also known as Chengdu Plain and Chuanxi Basin, located in the western part of Sichuan Basin. The plain is small, with cross-crossed hills, surrounded by many mountains and plateaus in Sichuan.
                    As for the climate conditions in this region, the subtropical monsoon humid climate provides rich precipitation and less sunshine, which shapes the special local architectural style of Traditional Western Sichuan Dwellings: “roofing without sheathing” facilitates airflow and dehumidifies. Moreover, the special local climate —skew wind and drizzle but less sunshine, makes a unique architectural design, “the wide corbel”.

                    In the overall layout, the land of Western Sichuan Plain is divided into many small areas by dense water networks in paddy fields , meanwhile most dwellings scatter along with the fields, forming the unique “Linpan Western Sichuan”—villages featuring forests or bamboo groves, canal, dwellings, and field, where dwellings usually have three main types of interior decoration. First, it is common to see decorations related to social life such as fishing, wooding, farming and studying. Also, motifs of livestock and poultry such as cattle, horses, chickens and ducks are painted on the trapdoor and eaves. Moreover, some patterns representing the good will of praying for a bumper harvest and good weather are used in residential decorations.

                <p class="main_body_text">
                    Confucian culture, an important part of Chinese traditional cultures, influences the layout of Traditional Western Sichuan Dwellings. For example, in quadrangle dwellings, the layout of inner chambers manifests the Confucian principle of the hierarchy of feudal family. These dwellings are arranged by the principle that "the house facing the south is for the senior, the two-sided wing-rooms for the younger generation, the house facing the north is for the guests, and the storeroom is attached to the main building", which demonstrates the essence of Confucian culture: the Father-loving and Son-obeying, the harmonious relations between the couple, the respect for older brother and the genuine friendship. However, in the past, the long distance between Western Sichuan and the Central China made it hard to communicate smoothly for people, therefore the architecture style in Western Sichuan dose not completely conform with the orthodox Confucian culture. Instead, it creates some innovative transformations, the most outstanding one of which is the "skewed Longmen": the gate of some dwellings(in the shape of the Chinese character “eight”) does not open directly towards the main room and the road in front of it, but in an inclined angle. Local people hope this skewed gate helps ward off evil spirits and not expose their wealth.

                    Sichuan( also known as “Shu”) is the important birthplace of Taoism, and the Mount Qingcheng in Chengdu is the earliest Taoism sanctum. The core of Taoist thoughts lay great emphasis on the integration between nature and human, as well as the place pleasant to live. The famous “Linpan Western Sichuan” embodies such thoughts for these villages harmonize to dwell with nature —forest, canal, field, tightly. The appearances and talismans of “Eight Immortals”, the representative of Taoist culture, are often used as decorations of Traditional Western Sichuan Dwellings. Also the "Crane", commonly considered as a significant Taoist pattern, is used to express people's aspirations for good fortune, loyalty and longevity.

                    In history, eight immigration waves in Sichuan province had a profound impact on the evolution and development of its architectural culture. A large number of immigrants of other provinces entered Sichuan, bringing the architectural decoration technology and aesthetic concept of their original places. Some technologies are so eclectic that quickly integrated into the local architectural culture; others completely maintain their own customs and cultures, making the residential decoration in Chengdu Plain demonstrate different styles. The existence of Fujian Guild Hall and Guangdong Guild Hall in Chengdu Plain vividly records the true history of immigrants in that year, and at the same time, the unique fire seal in Southern China also enriches the local architectural shapes in western Sichuan.
